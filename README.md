### Hi there 👋

Hello, I’m **Rick (Chien Lin)** — a developer who enjoys exploring the boundary between **technology and humanity**.  
Lately, my main focus has been on how **AI Agents** reshape **human-computer interaction**, and what kind of design principles could make these systems feel more natural, expressive, and truly assistive.

I’ve been involved in several **agent-related projects at ByteDance**, while also running personal explorations to better understand the architecture and interaction patterns behind frameworks like **LangGraph** and **Agno**.

Here are some earlier projects that reflect my curiosity and craftsmanship:

1. 🧭 **CSU iOSClub Official Site** — a Svelte-based static site built for the iOS developer community.

2. 🔐 **Open-Source Contributions** — active contributor in the Casbin ecosystem, focusing on `Casdoor-Vue-SDK` and `Confita`.

3. 🌳 **Huffman Tree Visualizer** — an interactive web app to help students understand Huffman encoding.
