### Hi there 👋

Hello, I’m **Rick (Chien Lin)** — a developer who enjoys exploring the boundary between **technology and humanity**.  
Lately, my main focus has been on how **AI Agents** reshape **human-computer interaction**, and what kind of design principles could make these systems feel more natural, expressive, and truly assistive.

I’ve been involved in several **agent-related projects at ByteDance**, while also running personal explorations to better understand the architecture and interaction patterns behind frameworks like **LangGraph** and **Agno**.
